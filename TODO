TODO LIST
=========

* Generators to add
-[X] ISAAC
-[X] Mersenne Twister
-[X] Parisi-Rapuano
-[X] WELL
-[X] Xorshift
-[ ] Everyone that I don't know and is interesting =)

* Documentation to write
-[ ] ISAAC
-[ ] Mersenne Twister
-[ ] Parisi-Rapuano
-[ ] WELL
-[ ] Xorshift

* General things to do:
-[ ] Decide and add a license
-[X] Investigate a way to 'portably' use 32 and 64 bits
        numbers.
-[ ] Write a little 'extra' to generate numbers according
        to a distribution. This has some problems:
        - Some ways need a fixed number of random numbers
        - Some don't, for theese I will have to study a
            way to pass a generator so the function can
            produce all the numbers it needs.
-[ ] Investigate a better way to have a preferred generator
-[ ] Investigate the possibility of adding
        'Quasi-random Sequences' or also called
        'low-discrepancy Sequences'
